### **1. What is BeautifulSoup, and how does it work?**  
`BeautifulSoup` is a Python library used for web scraping by extracting data from static HTML and XML pages. It **parses** the webpage's source code, allowing users to navigate and search the document using Pythonic methods.  

**How it works:**  
1. Fetch the webpage's HTML using a library like `requests` or `urllib`.  
2. Pass the HTML content to `BeautifulSoup` for parsing.  
3. Use methods like `.find()`, `.find_all()`, and CSS selectors to extract data based on `tags`, `classes`, `IDs`, or `attributes`.  

---

### **2. What are the main features of BeautifulSoup?**  
The key features of BeautifulSoup are:  
✅ **Lightweight** – It requires minimal code and dependencies.  
✅ **Easy-to-use** – Simple syntax for searching and extracting data.  
✅ **Powerful Parsing** – Supports multiple parsers (`html.parser`, `lxml`, `html5lib`).  
✅ **Handles Broken HTML** – Can parse and extract data even from poorly structured HTML.  
✅ **Supports Searching** – Find elements using `.find()`, `.find_all()`, and CSS selectors.

### **3. How do you install BeautifulSoup and set up your environment for web scraping?**  

#### **Step 1: Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**  
```bash
python -m venv scraping_env
source scraping_env/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
scraping_env\Scripts\activate  # Windows
```

#### **Step 2: Install Required Libraries**  
```bash
pip install beautifulsoup4 requests lxml
```

#### **Step 3: Import and Set Up BeautifulSoup**  
```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

url = "https://example.com"
response = requests.get(url)
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, "html.parser")

print(soup.title.text)  # Extracts the page title
```

### **4. How do you parse HTML content using BeautifulSoup?**  
Parsing HTML content with BeautifulSoup depends on the parser you choose:  
- **HTML Parser (`html.parser`)** – Built into Python, suitable for basic parsing.  
- **LXML (`lxml`)** – Faster and supports XPath.  
- **HTML5Lib (`html5lib`)** – Best for handling broken HTML.  

**Example:**
```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

html_content = "<html><body><h1>Hello, World!</h1></body></html>"
soup = BeautifulSoup(html_content, "html.parser")

print(soup.h1.text)  # Output: Hello, World!
```

---

### **5. How do you find and extract elements from an HTML document using BeautifulSoup?**  
To find elements, you can use:  
- `.find(tag_name)` – Returns the first occurrence.  
- `.find_all(tag_name)` – Returns a list of all occurrences.  
- `soup.select("CSS selector")` – Extract elements using CSS selectors.  

**Example:**
```python
soup.find("h1")          # Finds the first <h1> tag
soup.find_all("p")       # Finds all <p> tags
soup.select("div.class") # Finds all <div> with class="class"
```

---

### **6. Explain the difference between `.find()` and `.find_all()` methods in BeautifulSoup.**  
| Method | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `.find()` | Returns the first matching element. | `soup.find("a")` → First `<a>` tag |
| `.find_all()` | Returns a list of all matching elements. | `soup.find_all("a")` → All `<a>` tags |

**Example:**
```python
first_link = soup.find("a")  # Gets the first <a> tag
all_links = soup.find_all("a")  # Gets all <a> tags in a list
```

---

### **7. How do you extract specific attributes like `href` or `src` from HTML tags?**  
You can treat tags like dictionaries and extract attributes using `.get()`.  

**Example:**
```python
link = soup.find("a")
print(link["href"])  # Extracts href attribute
print(link.get("href"))  # Another way to extract
```

---

### **8. How do you navigate through HTML tags using BeautifulSoup?**  
BeautifulSoup provides different ways to move through HTML elements:  
- `.parent` – Move up  
- `.children` – Move down  
- `.next_sibling` – Next element  
- `.previous_sibling` – Previous element  

**Example:**
```python
first_paragraph = soup.find("p")
print(first_paragraph.parent)  # Gets the parent tag
print(list(first_paragraph.children))  # Gets child elements
print(first_paragraph.next_sibling)  # Gets the next element
```

---

### **9. How do you handle pagination when scraping data from a website using BeautifulSoup?**  
Pagination is handled by:  
1. Finding the **"Next"** button link.  
2. Looping through pages until the button disappears.  

**Example:**
```python
while True:
    page = requests.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(page.text, "html.parser")

    scrape_data(soup)  # Custom function to extract data

    next_button = soup.find("a", text="Next")  # Find next button
    if next_button:
        url = next_button["href"]  # Update URL
    else:
        break
```

---

### **10. How do you clean and process scraped data using BeautifulSoup?**  
Use **Pandas** for structuring and processing data.  

**Example:**
```python
import pandas as pd

data = {"Title": ["Book 1", "Book 2"], "Price": ["$10", "$15"]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

df["Price"] = df["Price"].str.replace("$", "").astype(float)  # Remove $ and convert to float
print(df)
```
